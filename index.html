    <p>
        Smartphones are a class of mobile phones and of multi-purpose mobile computing devices. They are distinguished
        from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, which
        facilitate wider software, internet including web browsing over mobile broadband), and multimedia
        functionality including music, video, cameras, and gaming, alongside core phone functions such as voice calls
        and text messaging. Smartphones typically contain a number of metal–oxide–semiconductor integrated circuit
        chips, include various sensors that can be leveraged by their software such as a magnetometer, proximity
        sensors, barometer, gyroscope, or accelerometer, and support wireless communications protocols such as
        Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or satellite navigation.
